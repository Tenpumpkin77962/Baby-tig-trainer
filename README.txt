Stainless TIG Trainer â€” Mobile PWA Demo
Files included:
- index.html
- app.js
- manifest.json
- sw.js
- icons/icon-192.png (SVG placeholder)
- icons/icon-512.png (SVG placeholder)

How to use locally:
1. Download the ZIP and unzip to a folder on your computer or phone.
2. On a computer: open index.html in a browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox). For full PWA install and service-worker caching, serve via a local HTTP server (e.g. `python -m http.server` in the folder) then open http://localhost:8000.
3. On Android phone: upload the folder to a web server or run locally via HTTP. Opening index.html directly in the file manager may work in some browsers, but for PWA installation use an HTTP(s) server.
4. To install: open the app in Chrome on Android, then use the browser prompt or "Add to Home screen".

Notes:
- This is a simulation. Always practice real welding under supervision.
- If you'd like, I can: improve visuals, add logging, export session CSV, add tutorials, or prepare an APK using Capacitor/PhoneGap.
